    Garni pagan temple and Geghard cave Monastery
  </p>
  <p>
    The Temple of Garni (Armenian: “Garnu tacar”) is located in the village of Garni in Kotayk Province, Armenia, and it was once a pagan temple dedicated to the Armenian sun god Mihr.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built in the middle of the 1st century CE, the Temple of Garni remarkably survived the destruction of pagan temples following Armenia's conversion to Christianity in the 4th century CE, and countless invasions and earthquakes until its collapse in 1679 CE.
  </p>
  <p>
    After continuous excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries CE, the Temple of Garni was reconstructed between 1969-1975 CE.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, it is the only free-standing Greco-Roman structure in Armenia and seen by many as a potent symbol of Armenia’s classical past as well as its deep historical ties to the civilizations of Greece and Rome.

    Geghard
  </p>
  <p>
    First called Ayrivank, or the Monastery of the Caves, the history of Geghard dates back to pre-Christian times.
  </p>
  <p>
    The present buildings here date back the 10th-13th centuries, when the monastery was renamed Geghard, meaning «spear» or «lance» in Armenian.
  </p>
  <p>
    The association itself harkens back to the times of Jesus, when a spear was used by a Roman soldier to pierce the body of Christ during the Crucifixion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The spear was long housed at Geghard, but is now in the museum of Ejmiatsin Cathedral. Geghard is an architectural wonder – a complex of churches hewn from within a mountain of solid rock.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most ancient cave-church of St Gregory (7th century) is outside the monastery walls.  Geghard Monastery is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
