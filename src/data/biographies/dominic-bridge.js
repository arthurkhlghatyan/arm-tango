    Dominic has been working in tango full-time since 2007. He has taught and performed in international tango festivals, cultural events, and offered workshops in over a dozen countries around the world, including Buenos Aires.

    A passionate dancer and instructor and a pioneer of a unique style and teaching methodology, he draws inspiration and knowledge from a multitude of other dance-forms, yoga, meditation, and martial arts. For him, respect, generosity, and self-awareness are the keys to reaching the deeper realms of tango.

    Dominic specializes in the social dance of tango, in creative improvisation and musicality. He has trained many tango teachers in and outside the United States, and has studied with and worked alongside today’s top tango artists in the world. He enjoys working with all levels of experience, including first-time dancers.
