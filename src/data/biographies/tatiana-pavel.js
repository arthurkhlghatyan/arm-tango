  Tatiana & Pavel dancing together since year 2013. Tatiana founded first school of Argentinean tango in Moldova in 2010, and also organized 3 big festivals and 3 marathons, common known as MADT. Tatiana & Pavel was first tango couple originally from Moldova, who teached and performed across the country - in Romania (Bucharest, Iasi), Ukraine (Odessa), Spain (Valencia). They learned from such great maestros as: Javier Rodriguez & Noelia Barsi, Andres Laza Moreno & Luciana Arregui, Virginia Pandolfi & Jonatan Aguero. Tatiana & Pavel are 'obsessed' with the deepest parts of tango - strong connection through physics (embrace and posture) and metaphysics (openminded and accepting mood, joy of share and receive emotions in dance). Besides that, they both don't like just one thing: when a student goes out from their lesson in bad mood.
