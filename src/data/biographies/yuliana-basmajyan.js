    Born and raised in Armenia, Yuliana Basmajyan immigrated to the US in her early adolescent years. For many years she tested her skills in different dance forms, including modern, jazz, flamenco, and extensive training in Salsa.
    After several years of Latin dancing she discovered her true calling, a dance that truly inspired and challenged her…Tango.
    Over the span of several years, Yuliana studied and trained in Argentina under world-class dancers such as Natalia Hills, Romina Levin, Andrea Misse, Corina Herrera, and Geraldine Rojas to name a few.

    One of Yuliana’s grandest visions was the creation of the first international tango competition in the United States.
    The Southern California Tango Championship and Festival over the last 5 years has become one of the best events in the United States and has attracted competitors from all around the world.
    To date, it has successfully brought competitors and social dancers together for a grand event that features world renowned instructors and orchestras.
    Plans are underway for SoCal 2020.
