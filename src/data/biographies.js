    Born and raised in Armenia, Yuliana Basmajyan immigrated to the US in her early adolescent years. For many years she tested her skills in different dance forms, including modern, jazz, flamenco, and extensive training in Salsa.  After several years of Latin dancing she discovered her true calling, a dance that truly inspired and challenged her…Tango. Over the span of several years, Yuliana studied and trained in Argentina under world-class dancers such as Natalia Hills, Romina Levin, Andrea Misse, Corina Herrera, and Geraldine Rojas to name a few.
    Yuliana Basmajyan and her former partner Brian Nguyen are the only couple to win two Tango Salon US Championships (2010 & 2011) and to make the finals at the Mundial World Championship in Buenos Aires 4 years in a row! They are also the only US couple to ever place at the Salon World Championship by taking home the bronze medal in 2011.  They have taught and performed in several festivals and milongas in the US and around the world, including events such as El Congreso in Toronto, Tijuana Tango Festival, San Diego Tango Festival, Fire & Ice Festival in Ann Arbor, Tucson Tango Festival in Tucson, Valentango in Portland, Tango Mundo Festival in Palm Springs, Mercury Cafe in Denver and La Nacional, Ukraine, and Nocturne Milongas in NYC as well as famous theaters in LA such as Nokia theatre, Wilshire Ebell theatre, Florentine Gardens and many high-end banquet halls in USA, Canada, and Mexico.

    Yuliana’s passion for tango has expressed itself in various ventures over time.  From 2009 to 2018, Yuliana hosted one of the most prestigious milongas in Los Angeles, Milonga Querida. She currently devotes her talents to teaching in LA at her new dance studio and show room in Burbank as well as teaching abroad. Yuli is also the exclusive distributor of Regina tango shoes, imported from Italy.
    One of Yuliana’s grandest visions was the creation of the first international tango competition in the United States. The Southern California Tango Championship and Festival over the last 5  years has become one of the best events in the United States and has attracted competitors from all around the world. To date, it has successfully brought competitors and social dancers together for a grand event that features world renowned instructors and orchestras. Plans are underway for SoCal 2020.

  'tatiana-gordinscaia-&-pavel-lozan': `
    Tatiana & Pavel dancing together since year 2013. Tatiana founded first school of Argentinean tango in Moldova in 2010, and also organized 3 big festivals and 3 marathons, common known as MADT. Tatiana & Pavel was first tango couple originally from Moldova, who teached and performed across the country - in Romania (Bucharest, Iasi), Ukraine (Odessa), Spain (Valencia). They learned from such great maestros as: Javier Rodriguez & Noelia Barsi, Andres Laza Moreno & Luciana Arregui, Virginia Pandolfi & Jonatan Aguero. Tatiana & Pavel are 'obsessed' with the deepest parts of tango - strong connection through physics (embrace and posture) and metaphysics (openminded and accepting mood, joy of share and receive emotions in dance). Besides that, they both don't like just one thing: when a student goes out from their lesson in bad mood.
