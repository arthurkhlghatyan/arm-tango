    The forest mountain climate, with its mild winds, warm winters and cool summers, makes Dilijan a popular resort town, as do the mineral springs that bring water rich in carbon dioxide straight to the surface. The mineral waters here have been compared to the springs in Borjomi, Georgia, and Vichy, France.

The most popular sights in Dilijan are Haghartsin 10th century and Goshavank 13th century Monasteries .
