    If there is a Paradise in Armenia, then it is the Garden of Eden, where you can start your secret path to our Hotel. The quietness and calmness  surrounding you will let your  soul attain an equilibrium… Reveal in yourself the harmonious adjustment  to nature, let the natural rhythms deprive you of the sense of reality…
