    Dance the emotion - one of the main characteristics of Dorit and Ronen's  tango, combined with very high level of technique and precision. 
    A strong emphasis on embrace, deep and real connection and uncompromised passion create their special and unique art of tango.
    Within this ambient they teach their tango classes with a nice combination of excellent didactic skills and the feeling of the love of the dance and the never ending joy of it .
