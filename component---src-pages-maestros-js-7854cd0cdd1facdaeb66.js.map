2007. He has taught and performed in international tango festivals, cultural events, and offered workshops in over a dozen countries around the world, including Buenos Aires.\n    A passionate dancer and instructor and a pioneer of a unique style and teaching methodology, he draws inspiration and knowledge from a multitude of other dance-forms, yoga, meditation, and martial arts. For him, respect, generosity, and self-awareness are the keys to reaching the deeper realms of tango.\n    Dominic specializes in the social dance of tango, in creative improvisation and musicality. He has trained many tango teachers in and outside the United States, and has studied with and worked alongside today’s top tango artists in the world. He enjoys working with all levels of experience, including first-time dancers.\n    In 2008, after intensive dance-study while living in Buenos Aires (his first of several trips) and rigorous training from Jaimes Friedgen, his most influential teacher, his career expanded to Europe. Apart from his tours in Europe and North America, Dominic has lived and taught locally in Portland, Florence, Moscow, Paris, and Budapest. He speaks fluent English, Spanish, French, and Italian.\n    From 2012-2013, he partnered with world-class dancer, Sigrid Van Tilbeurgh (France). Together they toured in festivals in Germany, France, Italy, Romania, Hungary, the Ukraine, and Russia, and performed with Solo Tango Orchestra from Moscow on two separate occasions.\n    He taught and performed alongside the likes of: Sebastian Arce and Mariana Montes, Ariadna Naveira and Fernando Sanchez, Carlitos Espinoza and Noelia Hurtado, Rodrigo Palacios and Agustina Berenstein, Diego “El Pájaro” Riemer and María Belen Giachello, Cristian Sosa and María Noel Sciuto (2012 Tango Escenario World Champions), Julio Balmaceda and Corina de la Rosa, Pablo Inza and Eugenia Parilla, Fausto Carpino and Stephanie Fesneau, Mario Consiglieri and Anabella Diaz-Hojman, and Pablo Verón (The Tango Lesson, 1997), among others.\n    In 2013, while residing in Paris, Dominic performed in the live spectacle 52ème Gala de l’Union des Artistes, mis en scène by Isabelle Nanty, with French film star Audrey Fleurot (Intouchables, 2011), televised on France 2 with over 4 million viewers. He was also invited as “tango coach” for actor Hugh Laurie (Dr. House) for a T.V. commercial by L’Oréal.\n    In 2014 he taught and performed with Cecilia Piccinni from Buenos Aires in Tango Cazino 3rd Edition (Romania); Winter Tango Napoli Festival (Italy); live in concert with the Orquesta Típica La Juan D’Arienzo from Buenos Aires in Budapest; and toured in three festivals and nine cities around the United States in Winter 2015.\n    In 2015 he moved back to Portland to share his knowledge and passion with the tango community that originally raised him. During this time he began establishing PDX Tango, which hosted weekly classes, practicas and milongas. After two years of community-building and organizing, he returned to Europe and has been living in Berlin since 2018 while he continues his tours around the continent.\n  `,\n  'ronen-&-dorit': `\n    Dance the emotion - one of the main characteristics of Dorit and Ronen's  tango, combined with very high level of technique and precision. \n    A strong emphasis on embrace, deep and real connection and uncompromised passion create their special and unique art of tango.\n    Within this ambient they teach their tango classes with a nice combination of excellent didactic skills and the feeling of the love of the dance and the never ending joy of it .\n    They have been united since 2015 and established their own Tango School in Tel Aviv, Israel- \n    WeTango❤ Ronen & Dorit.\n    They have performed in all Israel with Tango Orchestras, Classic Orchestras and band like Balkan Beat Box!\n    They have participated in Tango Festivals and events in Spain- \"Mar del Tango Festival\", Hungary- \"Tango Mistico Week\" in Budapest and around the world with MSC Cruise ship teaching and performing!\n  `,\n  'tatiana-gordinscaia-&-pavel-lozan': `\n    Tatiana & Pavel dancing together since year 2013. Tatiana founded first school of Argentinean tango in Moldova in 2010, and also organized 3 big festivals and 3 marathons, common known as MADT.\n    Tatiana & Pavel was first tango couple originally from Moldova, who teached and performed across the country - in Romania (Bucharest, Iasi), Ukraine (Odessa), Spain (Valencia). They learned from such great maestros as: Javier Rodriguez & Noelia Barsi, Andres Laza Moreno & Luciana Arregui, Virginia Pandolfi & Jonatan Aguero. Tatiana & Pavel are 'obsessed' with the deepest parts of tango - strong connection through physics (embrace and posture) and metaphysics (openminded and accepting mood, joy of share and receive emotions in dance). Besides that, they both don't like just one thing: when a student goes out from their lesson in bad mood.\n  `,\n  'armenian-national-philharmonic-orchestra': `\n    The Armenian National Philharmonic Orchestra (ANPO) was founded in 1925 by Arshak Adamyan and Alexander Spendiaryan. For many years it has been considered as one of the leading orchestras of the former Soviet Union. Today, it is a national center of the professional orchestral music in Armenia.\n    Over the years, conductors Arshak Adamyan, Alexander Spendiaryan, Suren Charekyan, Gevorg Budaghyan, Konstantine Saradjian, Mikayel Maluntsyan, Ohan Durian, Mikayel Terian, Ruben Vartanian, Aram Katanyan, David Khandjian, Valery Gergiev, Vag Papian, Mikayel  Avetisyan and Loris Tjeknavorian have directed the orchestra. In October 2000 Eduard Topchjan was appointed the Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of the ANPO.\n    The Armenia National Philharmonic Orchestra’s home is the Aram Khachaturian Concert Hall, one of the architectural pearls of Yerevan designed by Alexander Tamanian. It hosts an audience of 1300 seats.\n    Being led to the new millennium by Maestro Eduard Topchjan the ANPO is committed to promoting cultural, musical awareness in local audiences, by regular performances of classical and contemporary music in addition to operatic repertoire.\n    Since its foundation, the orchestra has performed most of the classical repertoire. Besides, the ANPO widely presents works of the Armenian composers, including premieres of the new works in the program, which are of much interest for both Armenian and foreign audience.\n    Many of the world’s leading artists, such as David Oistrach, Sviatoslav Richter, Mstislav Rostropovich, Emil Gilels, Renato Bruson, Steven Isserlis, Misha Mayski, Sergei Nakariakov, Boris Berezovsky, Natalia Gutman, Giuseppe Giacomini, Isabelle Faust, Julia Fischer, Pinchas Zukerman, Gidon Kremer, Yuri Bashmet, Placido Domingo and many others, as well as already established and emerging Armenian musicians have appeared with this orchestra.\n    The orchestra’s performances have been led by Alexander Melik-Pashayev, Willy Ferrero, Franz Konwitschny, Kurt Masur, Valery Gergiev and many other celebrated conductors. For five successive years, Maestro Valery Gergiev has been the Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of the ANPO.\n    The renowned composers such as Gia Kancheli, Sofya Gubaidullina, Rodion Shchedrin have closely cooperated with the ANPO. Aram Khachaturian, Dmitry Kabalevsky, Krzysztof Penderecki and other composers have conducted their works with the Armenian National Philharmonic Orchestra.\n    The ANPO tours regularly and serves as a unique Ambassador of Armenian music worldwide. A number of internationally acclaimed Armenian soloists have appeared with the ANPO, among them: Sergey Khachatryan, Kim Kashkashian, Sergei Babayan, Isabel Bayrakdarian, Suren Bagratuni, Alexander Chaushian, Narek Hakhnazaryan and others.\n    Since 1989 the ANPO has toured extensively throughout the USA, Canada, Austria, Germany, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Lebanon, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Greece, Iran, Cyprus, Turkey, Russia, UAE and elsewhere.\n    The orchestra’s tours to Japan (with 15 concerts in 2008); Slovakia and Germany (2010), Italy (2014, 2015, at 4 prestigious festivals in Rimini, Citta di Castello, Merano and Ravello), Germany, Poland, USA, Mexico and Scandinavian countries were a great success.\n    On July 12, 2016 the ANPO appeared at prestigious “Stars of the White Nights” festival  with a concert at St. Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre.\n    On the occasion of its 90th anniversary, the ANPO was awarded with the “Coats of Arms of Yerevan” commemorative medal by the Mayor of Yerevan.\n    Since 2007 the Armenian National Philharmonic Orchestra hosts the annual Yerevan International Music Festival, held in autumn.
