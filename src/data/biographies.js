    Dominic has been working in tango full-time since 2007. He has taught and performed in international tango festivals, cultural events, and offered workshops in over a dozen countries around the world, including Buenos Aires.
    A passionate dancer and instructor and a pioneer of a unique style and teaching methodology, he draws inspiration and knowledge from a multitude of other dance-forms, yoga, meditation, and martial arts. For him, respect, generosity, and self-awareness are the keys to reaching the deeper realms of tango.

He has trained many tango teachers in and outside the United States, and has studied with and worked alongside today’s top tango artists in the world. He enjoys working with all levels of experience, including first-time dancers.

Apart from his tours in Europe and North America, Dominic has lived and taught locally in Portland, Florence, Moscow, Paris, and Budapest. He speaks fluent English, Spanish, French, and Italian.

    In 2015 he moved back to Portland to share his knowledge and passion with the tango community that originally raised him. During this time he began establishing PDX Tango, which hosted weekly classes, practicas and milongas. After two years of community-building and organizing, he returned to Europe and has been living in Berlin since 2018 while he continues his tours around the continent.

  'tatiana-gordinscaia-&-pavel-lozan': `
    Tatiana & Pavel dancing together since year 2013. Tatiana founded first school of Argentinean tango in Moldova in 2010, and also organized 3 big festivals and 3 marathons, common known as MADT.
    Tatiana & Pavel was first tango couple originally from Moldova, who teached and performed across the country - in Romania (Bucharest, Iasi), Ukraine (Odessa), Spain (Valencia). They learned from such great maestros as: Javier Rodriguez & Noelia Barsi, Andres Laza Moreno & Luciana Arregui, Virginia Pandolfi & Jonatan Aguero. Tatiana & Pavel are 'obsessed' with the deepest parts of tango - strong connection through physics (embrace and posture) and metaphysics (openminded and accepting mood, joy of share and receive emotions in dance). Besides that, they both don't like just one thing: when a student goes out from their lesson in bad mood.
