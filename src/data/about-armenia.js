  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    Armenia is situated at a cultural, historical, and religious intersection and located at the
    crossroads between Europe and Asia, in the southern Transcaucasus. The country spans
    29,743 square kilometers (11,490 square miles, about the size of Belgium or Maryland)
    of mountainous terrain centered on the Ararat Valley, the heart of the Armenian nation
    since biblical times. Ancient geographers called the Armenian Highlands the &quot;Island of
    Mountains&quot; or the &quot;Rooftop of Asia Minor.&quot; In fact, the average altitude of the country is
    over a mile high, at about 1800 meters above sea level. Presently, the country is
    landlocked and has no navigable waterways, in contrast to Historic Armenia, which at its
    height under King Tigran the Great, stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean
    Sea and was more than ten times the current size of the present day Republic. Armenia
    has borders with Georgia to the north, with Turkey to the west and south, with Azerbaijan
    to the east and southwest, and with Iran to the south.

    Armenia&#39;s landscapes offer boundless beauty. Seven main landscape types are represented
    across the different altitudinal zones of Armenia. Across these desert, semi desert, dry
    steppe, steppe, woodland, sub alpine and alpine zones is geography as diverse as high
    mountain peaks, fertile valleys, picturesque land formations, basalt columns, rock
    sculptures, and waterfalls. More than 200 rivers and streams traverse Armenia, with steep
    falls, rapids and swift currents. Armenia has 5 scenic canyons. In addition, there are over
    200 therapeutic mineral springs, differing in composition and temperature.

    The Armenians, an ancient people living on an ancient land, call Armenia &quot;Hayastan,&quot;
    and themselves â€œHay.&quot; Oral history explains the lineage of the Armenian people as being
    the direct descendants of Noah&#39;s son Habeth. The indigenous people of the land of Ararat,
    Armenians forged their national identity with the rise of powerful Armenian kingdoms,
    the adoption of Christianity as Armenia&#39;s state religion, and the creation of the Armenian
    alphabet, which spurred the development of literature, philosophy, and science.

  <h4>History</h4>
  <p>
    From ancient times, Armenians have cherished their artistic traditions, which reflect a
    unique culture and landscape. Aspects of everyday life are expressed in the most artistic
    fashion, in needlework, embellishments, carvings and design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Architecture is one of the most interesting art forms in Armenia, as, for example,
    churches bear artistic illustrations in frescoes and reliefs. Sculpting is everywhere - in
    nearly every city, town, and village in Armenia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Armenians love music, and they have been creating exquisite compositions for centuries.
    Sharakans are traditional Armenian liturgical songs, which are experiencing a revival
    today. Distinctive musical instruments are used to play Armenian folk songs. Sayat Nova,
    Komitas, and Aram Khachaturian are among Armenia&#39;s best-known musicians and
    composers. Contemporary music comes in the forms of jazz and pop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Literature has always played a vital role in Armenia&#39;s cultural and national identity.
    Christian culture and the invention of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots gave
    new stimuli to the development of unique cultural traditions. There is no better place to
    view this literary and artistic history than Yerevan&#39;s unique Matenadaran (Institute of
    Ancient Manuscripts), which houses an extraordinary collection of 14,000 complete
    manuscripts, fragments and miniatures.

    The Caucasus region and Armenia in particular have been cited by scholars as the place
    where rug and carpet weaving originated. Armenians continue this tradition, and one can
    find many shops specializing in fine new and old rugs and carpets. At the weekend flea
    market, rug sellers lay out their eye-catching merchandise filled with appealing colors
    and designs. At the same market, you will come across loads of charming handicrafts that
    will be hard to resist purchase. Visitors to Armenia find handmade crafts, Armenian gold,
    precious and semi-precious stones which inspire jewelers in many regions. Obsidian
    stone is used for jewelry, desk accessories, and decorative items. Carpet making is not
    only a fine art, but Kilim weaving, for example, is applied to clothing items, bags, and
    home furnishings. Wood carvings replicate the ancient stone crosses (khachkars) found
    throughout the country, and no two are exactly alike. Armenian crafts couple elegant
    utility and delightful whimsy in textiles, ceramics, metal and woodworking.

  <p>
    Armenia is often referred to as an open-air museum. Tourists find over 4,000 historical
    monuments throughout Armenia, covering various periods of the country&#39;s history from
    prehistoric to Hellenistic times, and from the early to medieval Christian era. The
    Armenians created their masterpieces during rare periods of peace and relative prosperity
    over the centuries. Within Yerevan alone there are more than 40 fine arts museums and
    galleries.

    About 94 percent of Armenians consider themselves to be Armenian Christians. Armenia
    became the first nation to declare Christianity as its state religion in 301 AD.
  </p>
  <p>
    Traditionally, the Armenian Church recognizes the Catholicos of All Armenians as its
    leader. He resides in Holy Etchmiadzin, where St. Gregory the Illuminator established the
    Armenian Church in 301 AD. A National Ecclesiastical Assembly consisting of lay and
    clergy representatives of Armenian communities around the world elects the Catholicos.
    There are four hierarchical Sees in the Armenian Church: the Catholicate of All
    Armenians in Etchmiadzin; the Catholicate of the Great House of Cilicia; the Patriarchate
    of Jerusalem; and the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Church entered its most recent
    era of leadership on October 27, 1999, when Armenian Christians chose His Holiness
    Garegin II as leader of their worldwide church following the death of Catholicos Garegin
    I.
  </p>
  <p>
    Small Roman Catholic and Protestant communities also exist in Armenia. Catholic
    missionaries began converting Armenians in the Ottoman and Persian empires in the
    early modern era, and American Protestant missionaries were active in the nineteenth
    century. The Kurdish population is mostly Yezidi or Muslim. A Russian Orthodox
    Church also serves its community.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Armenia became the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion, the
    need of an indigenous language arose in order to translate the Bible. A devoted scholar
    and monk, Mesrop Mashtots, created a distinctly Armenian alphabet after traveling all
    over Armenia to gather the sounds of Armenian speech. In 405 AD he introduced the
    thirty-six unique characters that make up the basis of the Armenian alphabet. During the
    Middle Ages, two additional characters were added to write words borrowed from foreign
    languages.
