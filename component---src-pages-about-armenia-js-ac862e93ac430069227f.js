The country spans\n    29,743 square kilometers (11,490 square miles, about the size of Belgium or Maryland)\n    of mountainous terrain centered on the Ararat Valley, the heart of the Armenian nation\n    since biblical times. Ancient geographers called the Armenian Highlands the &quot;Island of\n    Mountains&quot; or the &quot;Rooftop of Asia Minor.&quot; In fact, the average altitude of the country is\n    over a mile high, at about 1800 meters above sea level. Presently, the country is\n    landlocked and has no navigable waterways, in contrast to Historic Armenia, which at its\n    height under King Tigran the Great, stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean\n    Sea and was more than ten times the current size of the present day Republic. Armenia\n    has borders with Georgia to the north, with Turkey to the west and south, with Azerbaijan\n    to the east and southwest, and with Iran to the south.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Armenia&#39;s landscapes offer boundless beauty. Seven main landscape types are represented\n    across the different altitudinal zones of Armenia. Across these desert, semi desert, dry\n    steppe, steppe, woodland, sub alpine and alpine zones is geography as diverse as high\n    mountain peaks, fertile valleys, picturesque land formations, basalt columns, rock\n    sculptures, and waterfalls. More than 200 rivers and streams traverse Armenia, with steep\n    falls, rapids and swift currents. Armenia has 5 scenic canyons. In addition, there are over\n    200 therapeutic mineral springs, differing in composition and temperature.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Armenians, an ancient people living on an ancient land, call Armenia &quot;Hayastan,&quot;\n    and themselves “Hay.&quot; Oral history explains the lineage of the Armenian people as being\n    the direct descendants of Noah&#39;s son Habeth. The indigenous people of the land of Ararat,\n    Armenians forged their national identity with the rise of powerful Armenian kingdoms,\n    the adoption of Christianity as Armenia&#39;s state religion, and the creation of the Armenian\n    alphabet, which spurred the development of literature, philosophy, and science.\n  </p>\n  <h4>History</h4>\n  <p>\n    From ancient times, Armenians have cherished their artistic traditions, which reflect a\n    unique culture and landscape. Aspects of everyday life are expressed in the most artistic\n    fashion, in needlework, embellishments, carvings and design.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Architecture is one of the most interesting art forms in Armenia, as, for example,\n    churches bear artistic illustrations in frescoes and reliefs. Sculpting is everywhere - in\n    nearly every city, town, and village in Armenia.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Armenians love music, and they have been creating exquisite compositions for centuries.\n    Sharakans are traditional Armenian liturgical songs, which are experiencing a revival\n    today. Distinctive musical instruments are used to play Armenian folk songs. Sayat Nova,\n    Komitas, and Aram Khachaturian are among Armenia&#39;s best-known musicians and\n    composers. Contemporary music comes in the forms of jazz and pop.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Literature has always played a vital role in Armenia&#39;s cultural and national identity.\n    Christian culture and the invention of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots gave\n    new stimuli to the development of unique cultural traditions. There is no better place to\n    view this literary and artistic history than Yerevan&#39;s unique Matenadaran (Institute of\n    Ancient Manuscripts), which houses an extraordinary collection of 14,000 complete\n    manuscripts, fragments and miniatures.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Caucasus region and Armenia in particular have been cited by scholars as the place\n    where rug and carpet weaving originated. Armenians continue this tradition, and one can\n    find many shops specializing in fine new and old rugs and carpets. At the weekend flea\n    market, rug sellers lay out their eye-catching merchandise filled with appealing colors\n    and designs. At the same market, you will come across loads of charming handicrafts that\n    will be hard to resist purchase. Visitors to Armenia find handmade crafts, Armenian gold,\n    precious and semi-precious stones which inspire jewelers in many regions. Obsidian\n    stone is used for jewelry, desk accessories, and decorative items. Carpet making is not\n    only a fine art, but Kilim weaving, for example, is applied to clothing items, bags, and\n    home furnishings. Wood carvings replicate the ancient stone crosses (khachkars) found\n    throughout the country, and no two are exactly alike. Armenian crafts couple elegant\n    utility and delightful whimsy in textiles, ceramics, metal and woodworking.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Armenia is often referred to as an open-air museum. Tourists find over 4,000 historical\n    monuments throughout Armenia, covering various periods of the country&#39;s history from\n    prehistoric to Hellenistic times, and from the early to medieval Christian era. The\n    Armenians created their masterpieces during rare periods of peace and relative prosperity\n    over the centuries. Within Yerevan alone there are more than 40 fine arts museums and\n    galleries.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    About 94 percent of Armenians consider themselves to be Armenian Christians. Armenia\n    became the first nation to declare Christianity as its state religion in 301 AD.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Traditionally, the Armenian Church recognizes the Catholicos of All Armenians as its\n    leader. He resides in Holy Etchmiadzin, where St. Gregory the Illuminator established the\n    Armenian Church in 301 AD. A National Ecclesiastical Assembly consisting of lay and\n    clergy representatives of Armenian communities around the world elects the Catholicos.\n    There are four hierarchical Sees in the Armenian Church: the Catholicate of All\n    Armenians in Etchmiadzin; the Catholicate of the Great House of Cilicia; the Patriarchate\n    of Jerusalem; and the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Church entered its most recent\n    era of leadership on October 27, 1999, when Armenian Christians chose His Holiness\n    Garegin II as leader of their worldwide church following the death of Catholicos Garegin\n    I.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Small Roman Catholic and Protestant communities also exist in Armenia. Catholic\n    missionaries began converting Armenians in the Ottoman and Persian empires in the\n    early modern era, and American Protestant missionaries were active in the nineteenth\n    century. The Kurdish population is mostly Yezidi or Muslim. A Russian Orthodox\n    Church also serves its community.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When Armenia became the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion, the\n    need of an indigenous language arose in order to translate the Bible. A devoted scholar\n    and monk, Mesrop Mashtots, created a distinctly Armenian alphabet after traveling all\n    over Armenia to gather the sounds of Armenian speech. In 405 AD he introduced the\n    thirty-six unique characters that make up the basis of the Armenian alphabet. During the\n    Middle Ages, two additional characters were added to write words borrowed from foreign\n    languages.\n
