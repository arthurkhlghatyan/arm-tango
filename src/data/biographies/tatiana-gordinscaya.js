    After she visited Buenos Aires, she decided that to put music on milongas is an art, and one part of this art is to create atmosphere of small Buenos Aires at the milonga. So she is tdjing on regular weekly milongas in Chisinau, after that she was tdjing at milongas in Odessa ( Ukraine) and at milongas, festivals and maraton in Romania ( In Iasi,  Bucharest, Brasov) ,also in Greece.

    Tatiana considers that music which put the tdj its a key of communication between people and tdj, and if there is a connection like in tango, than milonga will be succesfull. She is also organiser of Madtango marathon and Rockit!tango weekend in Chisinau!
